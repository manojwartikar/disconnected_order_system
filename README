# Disconnected Order Management System 
 
The "Disconnected Order Management System" is a Java 8 Spring Boot project designed to manage orders, users, and suppliers in a microservices architecture. This system leverages PostgreSQL for data storage, OAuth2 for security, and Logback for logging, with services containerized using Docker and orchestrated by Kubernetes. 
 
## Overview 
 
The system is architected as a microservices application using Java 8 and Spring Boot. Each service is independently deployable and scalable, communicating via RESTful APIs. The project integrates PostgreSQL as the database, managed through Hibernate for Object-Relational Mapping. OAuth2 is implemented for secure authentication and authorization, while Logback manages logging. Containerization is achieved with Docker, and Kubernetes handles orchestration for deployment and scaling. 
 
### Project Structure 
 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Hibernate ORM 
- **Security**: OAuth2 for authentication and authorization 
- **Logging**: Logback configured for INFO and ERROR levels 
- **Containerization**: Docker 
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes 
- **Microservices Communication**: RESTful APIs 
 
## Features 
 
- **User and Supplier Management**: Create, update, and delete users and suppliers with data validation. 
- **Order Management**: Create, update, and cancel orders with notifications for cancellations. 
- **Catalog Management**: Manage catalog items with create, update, and delete options. 
- **Order Fulfillment**: Accept, decline, and update delivery status with user notifications. 
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging. 
- **Data Validation**: Rigorous validation for all API inputs.
